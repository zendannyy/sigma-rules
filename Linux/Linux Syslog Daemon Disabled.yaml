title: Linux Syslog Daemon Stopped or Killed
id: f9a2c17-3e8b-4d1f-a089-6c1d245a6b7c
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects an adversary stopping or killing the syslog daemon (syslog,
    rsyslog, or syslog-ng), which is responsible for forwarding system
    events to /var/log and to SIEM collectors.

    Stopping the syslog daemon is distinct from clearing existing logs —
    it cuts the live telemetry pipeline at the source. Any activity
    occurring after the daemon is stopped produces no log records
    whatsoever, creating a blind spot.
